# Lenient profile that is intended to be used when 'Ux' is desired but
# does not provide enough environment sanitizing. This effectively is an
# open profile that blacklists certain known dangerous files and also
# does not allow any capabilities. For example, it will not allow 'm' on files
# owned be the user invoking the program. While this provides some additional
# protection, please use with care as applications running under this profile
# are effectively running without any AppArmor protection. Use this profile
# only if the process absolutely must be run (effectively) unconfined.
#
# Usage:
# Because this abstraction defines the sanitized_helper profile, it must only
# be #included once. Therefore this abstraction should typically not be
# included in other abstractions so as to avoid parser errors regarding
# multiple definitions.
#
# Limitations:
# 1. This does not work for root owned processes, because of the way we use
#    owner matching in the sanitized helper. We could do a better job with
#    this to support root, but it would make the policy harder to understand
#    and going unconfined as root is not desirable any way.
#
# 2. For this sanitized_helper to work, the program running in the sanitized
#    environment must open symlinks directly in order for AppArmor to mediate
#    it. This is confirmed to work with:
#     - compiled code which can load shared libraries
#     - python imports
#    It is known not to work with:
#     - perl includes
# 3. Sanitizing ruby and java
#
# Use at your own risk. This profile was developed as an interim workaround for
# LP: #851986 until AppArmor utilizes proper environment filtering.
